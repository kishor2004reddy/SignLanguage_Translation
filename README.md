# 🤟 Sign Language Translation System (ASL)

A real-time **Sign Language Translation** system that recognizes **American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures** using a webcam and converts them into readable text. The project leverages **Computer Vision, MediaPipe, and Deep Learning (MobileNetV2)** for accurate and smooth real-time predictions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project captures live video from a webcam, detects hands using **MediaPipe Hands**, and classifies ASL gestures using a **MobileNetV2-based CNN model** trained on the ASL Alphabet dataset. Predictions are stabilized using a rolling buffer and displayed as a sentence in real time.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Captures live video from webcam  
2. Detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe  
3. Crops and preprocesses hand region  
4. Passes image to trained CNN model  
5. Smooths predictions using buffer  
6. Forms sentence from detected signs  
7. Displays translated text in real time
